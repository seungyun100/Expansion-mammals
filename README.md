# The range of large terrestrial mammals has expanded into human-dominated landscapes in Japan

**Supplementary Code Repository for the Manuscript:**

This repository is supplemental to the following manuscript

Baek S.-Y., Amano T., Akasaka M., and Koike S.  *The range of large terrestrial mammals has expanded into human-dominated landscapes in Japan*

This repository contains code used to estimate the process of range expansion, analyze drivers of range expansion (occupation model; 2~7), and generate coefficient plots for Figure 3, which presents results from the analysis of range expansion drivers(8).

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following scripts:


**1. Covariables (in code)**: Prepares environmental variables required for analyzing drivers of range expansion.

**2. Expansion process and occupation model for Sika deer (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of sika deer and analyzes the drivers of its expansion.

**3. Expansion process and occupation model for Wild boar (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of wild boar and analyzes the drivers of its expansion.

**4. Expansion process and occupation model for Black bear (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of Asiatic black bears and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**5. Expansion process and occupation model for Serow (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of Japanese serows and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**6. Expansion process and occupation model for Macaque (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of Japanese macaques and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**7. Expansion process and occupation model for Brown bear (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of brown bears and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**8. Generating coefficient plots (in code)**: Generates Figure 3, showing coefficient plots from the occupation models.
