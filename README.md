# The range of large terrestrial mammals has expanded into human-dominated landscapes in Japan

**Supplementary Code Repository for the Manuscript:**

This repository is supplemental to the following manuscript

Baek S.-Y., Amano T., Akasaka M., and Koike S.  *The range of large terrestrial mammals has expanded into human-dominated landscapes in Japan*

This repository contains code used to estimate the process of range expansion, analyze drivers of range expansion (occupation model; 2~7), and generate plots for Figure 3, 4, 5, and 6 (8~11).

## Repository Contents

**3. Expansion process and occupation model for Wild boar (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of wild boar and analyzes the drivers of its expansion.

**4. Expansion process and occupation model for Black bear (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of Asiatic black bears and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**5. Expansion process and occupation model for Serow (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of Japanese serows and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**6. Expansion process and occupation model for Macaque (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of Japanese macaques and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.

**7. Expansion process and occupation model for Brown bear (in code)**: Estimates the range expansion process of brown bears and analyzes the drivers of their expansion.
